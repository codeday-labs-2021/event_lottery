# Weighted Lottery Event System
A service & web application for weighted lottery based event registration. It allows you to create events and invite friends, but the service holds a lottery in order to determine who receives a formal invitation. Useful for cases where you have reoccurring IRL events with limited capacity, and where you want people who haven't had the chance to attend will less likely to be chosen than those who've attended before. Would involve backend and frontend work. Key features would be SMS based notifications and confirmation (so two-way SMS) along with event creation and registration.

## Script
